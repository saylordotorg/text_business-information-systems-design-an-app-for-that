        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s01_p01">A schematic report minimally contains the following elements.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_o02" numeration="arabic">
            <li>Title page with author.</li>
            <li>Executive summary: A summary analysis of the report with the key facts, issues, and conclusions. An executive should be able to get the gist of your entire report just by reading the executive summary.</li>
            <li>Table of contents—with page numbers identifying section and second level headings only.</li>
            <li>Introduction.</li>
            <li>Body: that includes the analysis and recommendations (most of your report). To provide continuity the evidence should point back to the main argument.</li>
            <li>Conclusion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s01_p02">The report may also include a letter of transmittal, references, and appendices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s01_p03">If a schematic report contains too much detail to be projected, what can you use for your presentation? The solution is to create two decks—a schematic report intended to be read and an accompanying <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">presentation</a><span class="glossdef">A presentation primarily designed to be projected which combines brief text and graphics. Presentations use few words and large fonts for audience readability.</span></span> intended to be projected. The task is not as hard as it might seem. Schematic reports tend to be heavy on graphics. All of those graphics can be copied from the schematic report to the presentation report. Within the presentation, those graphics should be enlarged, perhaps to fill the entire screen. Key summary points can similarly be lifted from the schematic report while leaving the bulk of the text behind. The speaker will provide the gist of the text during the presentation. The two decks can even run in the same order so that the audience can follow along in the written report.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s01_p04">Hopefully, Microsoft will one day modify PowerPoint so that it produces the presentation automatically from the schematic. Here is how it might work. The writer tags text and graphics from the schematic report that are intended for the presentation. PowerPoint automatically enlarges the tagged graphics to fill the screen. The tagged text is similarly enlarged to at least 24 point, then placed in a text box overlaying the illustration—like subtitles in a foreign movie. When the slide loads it could even begin with the slide from the schematic, which then morphs to become the presentation slide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s01_p05">Until Microsoft provides the transformation utility, we will have to create the presentation from the schematic ourselves. The easiest way to do this is by beginning with the schematic and then stripping it down to the graphics and key text, then enlarging those and arranging them on the screen.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing an Executive Summary</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s02_p01">Every schematic report leads off with an executive summary. An executive summary usually occupies one page and summarizes the key facts, issues, and conclusions of the report. A manager should be able to garner enough information from the executive summary<span class="footnote" id="ch11_002_fn001">There are many definitions of an executive summary—some are highly specific. We have chosen to go with one of the more general definitions modified from: <a class="link" href="http://smallbusinessdictionary.com">smallbusinessdictionary.com</a></span> to make a decision. The rest of the report is effectively backup if there are questions that arise from the executive summary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s02_p02">Many times a senior level manager will not even read past the executive summary. Rather they will assign one or more junior level managers to follow up on a subsection of the report. Looked at this way, the executive summary is obviously something that you want to spend a lot of time crafting—not a reluctant chore at the end of the process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s02_p03">The key to writing an executive summary is to get quickly to the point. We can actually tie the parts of the executive summary back to terms with which we are already familiar:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_l01" mark="bullet">
            <li>Key facts—what is the current state? What are enablers that will help with the proposed solution?</li>
            <li>Issues—what are the barriers that would impede the proposed solution?</li>
            <li>Conclusions—what is the report specifically recommending? What course of action should the reader take?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s02_p04">One of the most common mistakes is to treat the executive summary as an introduction to the report. You will have an opportunity later to write a gentle introduction to the report, but not in the executive summary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch11_s02_s02_p05">Because our reports are relatively short, you probably will reference most sections in the executive summary. However, in a larger report, there may be entire foundation or due diligence sections not covered in the executive summary. That’s OK. You still need to do the due diligence to make your case. When deciding what to include simply ask yourself, would a manager need to know this to make a decision?</p>

            <img src="section_15/7b6baf87c2bfc8c9a66fdcf19d7ef5ea.png">
            <p class="para">An executive summary should highlight the key facts, issues, and conclusions of the report. The example above is pretty good, but it is missing the issues—what barriers are present that would prevent the proposed solution?</p>
