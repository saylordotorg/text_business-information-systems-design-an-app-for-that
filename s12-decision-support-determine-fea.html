        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Many businesses need a loan in order to cover <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">startup costs</a><span class="glossdef">These are fixed costs associated with starting a business. Often refers to one time costs.</span></span>. Many entrepreneurs will turn to family for a loan. However, the danger here is that you are risking not only your family’s money, but also the relationships if the business should go under.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s01_p02">On the other hand, small businesses without a prior track record sometimes have trouble securing a bank loan. Fortunately, there are government agencies at both the federal and state levels that help businesses secure grants and loans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s01_p03">Loan payments form part of the fixed costs of a business. Determining the payments on a loan is an important part of forecasting costs. The financial formula that calculates loan payments is fairly complex. However, Excel provides an easier way to calculate loan payments using the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">payment (PMT) function</a><span class="glossdef">A built in Excel function that calculates loan payments. Inputs to the function include the loan amount (pv), the interest rate (rate), and the number of loan payments (nper).</span></span>. The PMT function is one of many built in Excel functions. In this chapter we will examine functions, how they differ from formulas, and how to use them in a spreadsheet.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Where Are We in the Life Cycle?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s02_p01">Many information systems projects are conceived of in a life cycle that progresses in stages from analysis to implementation. The diagram below shows the stages that we touch in the current chapter:</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">

    <div class="section" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Functions vs. Formulas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p01">In the prior chapter we looked at Excel formulas and how to construct them. In many cases, we want to create our own formulas so we have a clear idea of how the information is constructed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p02">However, in some cases the formula might involve more complex math where the possibility for error is greater. In these cases it is better to use a built in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">function</a><span class="glossdef">A function is similar to a stored formula. However, functions usually hide details of the formula from the user. For example, we can use the PMT function to calculate loan payments without ever knowing the mathematical formula behind the function.</span></span> that has already been tested and debugged. There are also functions that avoid busywork that you could do yourself but would probably prefer not to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p03">On a small scale this is analogous to the build vs. buy issue. Think of formulas as things that you build whereas functions are things that you “buy.” We put buy in quotes because many functions, including the payment function, are bundled with Excel. That is part of the way that Excel maintains its leadership in the spreadsheet marketplace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p04">Most functions process input to produce a result. Perhaps the most popular function in Excel is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sum (SUM) function</a><span class="glossdef">Also represented by Σ, the sum function adds up a column or row of numbers.</span></span>, which adds up a long list of numbers. The input for the Sum function are the cells to be added together.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p05">The example below shows the sum function compared with the equivalent formula. The formula is obviously very tedious as it involves adding all the numbers. This is expressed as</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
					<span class="mathphrase">=A4+A5+A6+A7+A8+A9+A10+A11+A12</span>
				</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p06">The sum function accomplishes the same task more simplistically. This is expressed as</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
					<span class="mathphrase">=SUM(A4:A12)</span>
				</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p06a">Note that in both cases the result is the same: 1,427.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s03_p07">One nice advantage of the sum function is that if we were to add a row in the middle of the list, say between row 7 and row 8, the sum function would automatically expand to accommodate the new row, but the formula would not.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Payment (PMT) Function Calculates Loan Payments Automatically</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s04_p01">The payment (PMT) function calculates loan payments automatically. The format of the PMT function is:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
					<span class="mathphrase">=PMT(rate,nper,pv) correct for YEARLY payments</span>
				</span>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s04_l01" mark="bullet">
            <li>Rate is the interest rate, usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). If payments are made once a year then just plug in the APR. However, payments are usually once a month. So you need to divide the rate by 12.</li>
            <li>Nper is the number of payment periods. Again, if payments are made once a year then nper is just the number of years of the loan. However, payments are usually once a month. So you need to multiply the nper by 12.</li>
            <li>Pv is the present value of the loan, in other words the loan amount today.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s04_p03">Adjusting for monthly payments produces this modification of the function:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
					<span class="mathphrase">=PMT(rate/12,nper*12,pv) correct for MONTHLY payments</span>
				</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s04_p05">By the way, you can use the PMT function to calculate payments on car loans and home mortgages. In case you are curious, the actual mathematical formula that the PMT function translates to looks like this:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block">
					<span class="mathphrase">Payment = pv* apr/12*(1+apr/12)^(nper*12)/((1+apr/12)^(nper*12)-1)</span>
				</span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s04_p09">Note that it is hard to even follow a complex mathematical formula when it is written in Excel.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_12/5e52327dd69bf420734790413edbfd33.png">
            <p class="para">The payment (PMT) function in action. The wording in this illustration is taken directly from U.S. federal guidelines for loan disclosure. The PMT function is used to calculate the monthly payment—in this case $101. The function references three other numbers in the same illustration. Years is multiplied by 12 to get the number of payments (nper), APR% is divided by 12 to get the monthly interest rate, Amount Financed is the present value (pv) of the loan—the amount you are borrowing.</p>

    <div class="section" id="frost-ch08_s01_s05" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Payment (PMT) Function</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s05_p01">In the United States, the federal government places requirements on the actual wording of a loan. This wording is reflected in the illustration below. The intention is to force lenders to be honest about the terms of the loan and to allow buyers to comparison shop loans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s05_p02">Note especially the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">finance charge</a><span class="glossdef">The total interest paid over the life of the loan. The finance charge is calculated by adding up all of the loan payments and then subtracting from this total the amount originally borrowed.</span></span>
. This number is what people normally understand to be interest on the loan. It is the cost you pay for the privilege of borrowing the money. Now you might be wondering why this number is so high. After all 8% of $5,000 is only $400 not $1,083. The interest compounds or grows because the loan has been stretched out over five years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s05_p03">First time home buyers are often shocked to find that their finance charge actually exceeds the amount of the loan. In other words, over the life of the loan they end up paying around twice the closing price of the home. Home loans have higher finance charges because they are often stretched out over thirty years—which is a lot of time to compound interest. Similarly, if we were to stretch our $5,000 business loan out over thirty years, the finance charge climbs to $8,208, which exceeds the amount of the loan.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_12/9d257dd015ea87b184cd94c6f6188263.png">
            <p class="para">Here the same $5,000 loan is shown under different loan terms. The second loan increases the interest rate to 20%, but leaves all else unchanged from the original. The third loan increases the term of the loan to thirty years but leaves all else unchanged from the original. The lesson here is to borrow at as low an interest rate as possible and for as short a time as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s05_p04">So the bottom line is that you should borrow money for as short a time as possible to avoid large finance charges.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch08_s01_s05_p05">By the way, the situation is even worse with credit card loans because the interest rate on credit cards is so much higher—around 20%. Note how at 20% the finance charge climbs to almost $3,000 over five years. Your goal should be to pay off your credit card in full at the end of each month. If you do not have enough money to do this, then you should try to modify spending habits so that you reach this goal.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="frost-ch08_s01_s05_l01" mark="bullet">
                <li>Businesses sometimes need loans to cover startup costs. Ideally, these should be business loans rather than personal loans.</li>
                <li>At its heart, a function is simply a stored formula.</li>
                <li>Functions are pretested and debugged. They sometimes simplify complex mathematical formulas and/or eliminate busywork.</li>
                <li>One disadvantage of functions is that you sometimes lose a sense of how the information was derived.</li>
                <li>The PMT function calculates loan payments. Since most loan payments are monthly, the function needs to be modified by dividing the interest rate by 12, but multiplying the number of payment periods by 12.</li>
                <li>The United States federal government mandates that loan terms be expressed in a uniform way so that buyers are fully informed of credit terms and can comparison shop.</li>
                <li>Because interest is compounded, loans should be taken out for as few years as possible. Compound interest is especially painful at high interest credit card rates.</li>
