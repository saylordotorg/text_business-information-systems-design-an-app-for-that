        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Every information system is designed to improve business in some way. However, before making an improvement, it is critical to understand the current business process. In this chapter we will develop a technique to diagram business processes. We will first diagram the current business process—the so-called As-Is process. After studying the process, we will be in a position to propose and diagram a future process—the so-called To-Be process. If we have done our job well, the To-Be process will improve upon the As-Is process, making it more efficient, effective, user friendly, and so forth. In other words, every process improvement should move the business closer to achieving its goals.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Where Are We in the Life Cycle?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s02_p01">Many information systems projects are conceived of in a life cycle that progresses in stages from analysis to implementation. The diagram below shows the stages that we touch in the current chapter:</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">

    <div class="section" id="frost-ch02_s01_s03" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Goal Directed Activities.</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s03_p01">Implicit in each current and future state are one or more business processes. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business process</a><span class="glossdef">A set of goal directed activities.</span></span> is a set of goal directed activities. In other words, a process describes the actions To-Be taken to accomplish a task. For example, applying to a university, filing taxes, and evaluating employees are all processes. The steps in applying to a university might include filling out an online form, submitting a credit card payment, requesting test scores be sent, and requesting that high school transcripts be sent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s03_p02">Note that all of the processes mentioned above took place even before the advent of computers. Try to imagine how. Information systems simply transform the processes with the goal of making the process more efficient, convenient, effective, reliable, and so forth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s03_p03">First, we represent the current (usually deficient) state <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">As-Is process</a><span class="glossdef">The way the process functions right now before any intervention or redesign.</span></span>. Seeing the As-Is process diagrammed exposes obvious areas for improvement in the process. For example, many years ago students registered for classes in person. The As-Is process in that era might have shown a student waiting in line outside a large auditorium. When his turn comes up, the student enters the auditorium. There are tables representing each department staffed with faculty from that department. For each course that the student wishes to take, he must find the corresponding department table and add his name to the list for that class. Buying concert tickets followed a similar process before services like Ticket Master went online. People used to camp out for days in advance outside the Ticket Master office.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s03_p04">Sometimes information technology may improve processes, other times no technology is required. Sometimes the solution is as simple as providing information for individuals completing a business process at the appropriate time, or simply rearranging the steps in the business process, in which case, no new information technology is needed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s03_p05">The redesigned and improved business process is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">To-Be</a><span class="glossdef">The way the process will function after the redesign.</span></span> process. This process takes into consideration the deficiencies identified in the As-Is process and the goals of the business. The area of work that focuses on improving business processes is called business process redesign. Individuals performing this work focus on understanding the As-Is process and how to improve it in the To-Be process.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Initial Client Meeting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s04_p01">Obviously, you can not diagram a business process without understanding the business. This will require meetings with the client. It is best to walk into those meetings with a willingness to listen rather than pretending that you know the client’s business. Ask open ended questions and take lots of notes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s04_p02">Those that design systems are called business analysts or consultants. Analysts begin their work with an initial client meeting. The quality of the questions asked at that meeting may well determine the success or failure of the project. Using the following four open ended questions can help in this consulting situation (Starr, 2010):</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s04_s01_l01" mark="bullet">
            <li>Current state: What does the client see as the current state of the situation/project?</li>
            <li>Future state: What is the vision of the client for the end point of the situation/project?</li>
            <li>Barriers: What barriers does the client envision will hinder reaching the vision?</li>
            <li>Enablers: What is the client already doing to reach the vision? What does the client think will help?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s01_s04_p03">Note that these questions capture the aspirations of the client as well as perceived barriers and enablers to reach that vision. The assumption here is that the client knows her business pretty well, and the goal of the initial meeting is to capture her knowledge and vision without jumping to a solution.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p01">Improving a business process requires first understanding the process. Diagramming the steps in the process contributes greatly to that understanding. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Business process diagrams</a><span class="glossdef">Business processes may be represented by process diagrams containing actors in swim lanes and actions connected by arrows. Decision points in a business process are represented by diamonds.</span></span> typically consist of actions linked by arrows. However, it is also important to be clear about who is performing each action. For this reason we create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">swim lane</a><span class="glossdef">A vertical portion of a business process diagram.</span></span> for each actor in the process. The actors pass a metaphorical baton among themselves at different stages of the process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p02">An easy way to diagram a business process is to first identify all of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">actors</a><span class="glossdef">A person or computer who takes actions or makes decisions in a business process.</span></span> and place each in a swim lane. The process begins at the top of the page and continues down the page following the arrows. Arrows represent communication among the actors, while diamonds represent decision points. While actors are normally people, a computer standing in for the role of a person can also be an actor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p03">At times we can simplify the business process diagram by eliminating all but the essential elements. This makes the diagram less cluttered and easier to read. On the facing page we have a process diagram reduced to just three elements — swim lanes, actions, and arrows.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p04">For the level of analysis needed in this course, the simplified diagram is more than sufficient. However, it is good to know the full lexicon, especially the decision point diamond shown on the next page.</p>

Many commercials on TV are really advertisements for improved business processes. IBM has been particularly active in this arena. IBM’s focus on business process improvement makes sense given that IBM is one of the largest consulting organizations in the world. In this exercise, you will view a commercial on YouTube and then create the As-Is and To-Be business process diagrams that the commercial implicitly represents.</p>
