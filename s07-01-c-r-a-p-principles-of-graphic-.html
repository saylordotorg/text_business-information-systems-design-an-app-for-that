        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s01_p01">How much graphic design do you need in business? Considering the heavy emphasis that is currently placed on “the look” of deliverables, the answer might be a lot. We don’t pretend that you will become a master of graphic design after just one chapter. However, there are some survivor principles of graphic design laid out by Robin Williams. Those principles are <strong class="emphasis bold">contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity (C.R.A.P.)</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s01_p02">You will learn to see the world in a new way. For years, you have looked at magazine layouts, ads, banners, flyers, etc. Some have caught your eye and some have not. Unless you have been trained in graphic design, it would most likely be hard for you to vocalize what it is about a layout that appeals to you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s01_p03">The principles of graphic design, ad design, and type design will be repeated throughout the text when designing the following deliverables:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s01_l01" mark="bullet">
            <li>Ads</li>

            <li>Term papers</li>
            <li>PowerPoint presentations</li>
            <li>Spreadsheets</li>
            <li>Graphs</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s01_p04">Everything that you design in this course will have a professional feel to it. Our goal is to make your work indistinguishable from the work that appears in publications such as the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> and the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>. Realizing that goal will also help make you a valuable contributor in the workforce. Others will value your work as professional, polished and communicative. You will also be able to give guidance to others on how to improve the look of their deliverables.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Robin Williams</strong> Robin Williams is the author of the <em class="emphasis">Non-Designer’s Design Book</em>. This is an essential reference used even in graphic design programs.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Where Are We in the Life Cycle?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s02_p01">Many information systems projects are conceived of in a life cycle that progresses in stages from analysis to implementation. The diagram below shows the stages that we touch in the current chapter:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Contrast</a><span class="glossdef">The use of type, color, weight, and so forth to draw attention to specific elements on the page.</span></span> focuses our attention and should be used to highlight the most important points that the audience should take away. Designers should use colors, bold type, and size to distinguish parts of text or an image and create contrast. Contrast is used in all aspects of life. For example, jewelers usually display their diamond pieces on a background of black velvet to let the jewels stand out. The page you are reading uses headings to create contrast with the text.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Contrast Through Visual Weight</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s04_p01">Another way to create contrast is by using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">visual weight</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of ink dedicated to an element on the page. The more ink, the more contrast that is created.</span></span>. You create a focal point and then lead the reader’s eye around the page. The main focal point is the picture. The next “heaviest” item on the page is the headline, followed by the date, followed by the logo, followed by the body text. The reader’s eye is led from one item to the next based on these “weights.” The greatest mistake that most students make in flyer design is to make all the text the same size as though it needed to be readable from 20 feet away. As long as the picture and headline capture interest, a reader will move in closer to read the rest of the flyer. Also, if every item is the same size then nothing stands out and it looks unprofessional. Variation of font sizes and weights is critical to focus attention.</p>

    <div class="section" id="frost-ch03_s01_s05" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Contrast with Fonts: Type Design</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s05_p01">When working with type, aim for a contrasting layout. Contrasting layouts create visual interest and energy. For example, when you wear clothes of contrasting colors, such as red on navy blue, the outfit can be quite eye catching. Our examples will follow the conventions Robin Williams sets out in her book.<span class="footnote" id="ch03_001_fn001">Williams’ book, <em class="emphasis">The Non-Designers Design Book </em> discusses design principles for the novice designer.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s05_p02">The opposite of contrast is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">affinity</a><span class="glossdef">The opposite of contrast. Layouts demonstrating affinity show subtle variations in color or brightness.</span></span>. Layouts demonstrating affinity show subtle variations in color or brightness. The overall effect is pleasing, though not particularly remarkable. For example, a person wearing a dark suit with a dark tie would be wearing an outfit that shows affinity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s05_p03">In type design, a layout showing affinity is best for formal documents, such as wedding and graduation invitations. For most other documents, use a contrasting style to make your documents really pop. However, tailor the contrast to suit the audience and the occasion for the document. For example, a business plan prepared for a bank should have less contrast than the layout of this text book. When in doubt, be conservative.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s05_p04">The one type of layout that you must avoid is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conflicting layout</a><span class="glossdef">A layout in which type is very similar but different. The effect is disturbing to the eye, as though an error has taken place.</span></span>. In a conflicting layout the type is very similar but different. For example, never use two different serif fonts on the same page. Think of wearing an outfit that has two different shades of red that are very similar but different. The combination looks like a mistake—as though part of the outfit had faded in the wash. In the same manner two serif fonts side by side will look like a mistake. Fonts should be identical or very different.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s05_p05">The text on the next page is taken from The United States Declaration of Independence and demonstrates some type contrasting techniques. By increasing the font size and changing the text color, you can highlight certain words or information that you want to stand out. The goal is to make “Creator” stand out as the most important word in the sentence. You can also boldface to dramatize the weight of the text or italicize to accent the text. Direction refers to adding space between letters to make text stand out. Structure, using serif or sans serif fonts, can also differentiate text and will be discussed in the next section.</p>

    <div class="section" id="frost-ch03_s01_s06" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Contrast with Fonts: Serif/Sans Serif</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s06_p01">The two main categories of font are serif and sans serif. Serifs are the ornamental strokes at the end of the letters, which all serif fonts have. Sans serif means without serifs, therefore sans serif fonts do not have these decorative additions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s06_p02">Serif and sans serif fonts can be used together to create contrast within text. Typically sans serif fonts are used for headings while serif fonts are used for body text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s06_p03">Note that you should avoid combining two fonts that are from the same category. For example, two serif fonts that look similar, such as Georgia and Garamond, should not be used together.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s06_p04">Serif fonts are best used in text heavy books because the serifs quickly guide the reader’s eye from letter to letter. Sans serif fonts are the best choice for online text because serifs can blur in the pixels on a screen. The resolution of most computer screens is not sufficient to precisely draw the serifs in a body of text. The result tends to look blurry. Therefore, most websites use a sans serif font. An exception is sometimes made for the page title, which because of its greater font size, can show serifs much more clearly. To allow for serifs online, Microsoft developed a series of ClearType fonts designed to accurately reproduce serifs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s06_p05">Though font options are limited online, other techniques such as size, weight, color, form, and direction can be used to create contrast within online material. Color is especially powerful on a website as most viewers have a color monitor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s06_p06">Please see the Appendix for additional font categories. These include slab serif, modern, script, and decorative.</p>

One of its most spectacular features is the ability to upload an image and have Kuler automatically generate a color palette from that image. You then use that palette for fonts, fills, and so forth in your composition, and you are virtually guaranteed that the colors will all work well together.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s09_p02">To use the more interesting features of Kuler you must first create an account at: <a class="link" href="http://kuler.adobe.com">kuler.adobe.com</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch03_s01_s12_p01">Graphic design is perhaps the most creative aspect of information design. Though design leaves room for originality, there are clearly articulated principles every designer should follow to create clear and effective images. We will adopt four basic principles outlined by Robin Williams. These principles that have been introduced in the previous pages are: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity (C.R.A.P.).</p>

                <li>The same graphic design principles apply to computer screens, documents, and presentation graphics.</li>
                <li>The four graphic design principles are contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity (C.R.A.P.).</li>
                <li>Contrast helps to highlight and focus attention. Contrast may be achieved using color, shades of gray, size, visual weight, and so forth.</li>
                <li>Repetition helps to unite a document so that it looks like a</li>
                <li>coherent whole. Repetition may be achieved by repeating fonts, styles, images, and so forth.</li>
                <li>Alignment helps to organize information to make it clearer and more professional looking. Alignment may be achieved using onscreen guidelines.</li>
                <li>Proximity helps to establish relationships between items. Items in close proximity appear related.</li>
                <li>Type design may be used to reinforce contrast and/or repetition. Font, size, weight, color, form, and direction are all type design attributes.</li>
                <li>Colors should harmonize in a palette. Professional tools such as Kuler help to establish a color palette from an image.</li>
                <li>Fills and outlines can create contrast and/or repetition.</li>
                <li>Every ad should have a picture, headline, text, and logo.</li>

However, you can type up your signature in Word or PowerPoint and copy/paste it into Gmail with more inventive fonts.

            <p class="para" id="frost-ch03_s01_s13_p12">PowerPoint allows you to alter images to create a composition that does not really exist. Compositions like this should be done with caution. You don’t want to misrepresent anything to a potential client. In this case we are not selling the beach, just the idea of working from the beach, so no harm done. However, this would not be appropriate to advertise a resort. If this were a “photo” for a news article then altering the scene would actually be unethical. The example shown here is an ad for a restaurant, but you will be creating an ad for a cell phone provider—showcasing their ability to use the cell phone as a wifi <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hotspot</a><span class="glossdef">Your cell phone becomes a hotspot through a process called tethering. Tethering allows your computer to communicate to the internet by sending and receiving data over your cell phone’s data connection. Tethering is accomplished by creating a Bluetooth connection between your cell phone and your laptop. The laptop then sends/receives over both the Bluetooth connection and your cell phone’s data connection. Response time is faster if your cell phone has a 3G connection to the cell phone tower.</span></span> so that you can work from your laptop. You pick the provider and then include their logo and appropriate text in the ad.</p>
