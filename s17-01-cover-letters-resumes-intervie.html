        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s01_p01">There are at least two situations in which you will need to provide a cover letter and resume. One is when applying for a job. However, when you apply for a business loan you may also be asked for a resume. After all the bank wants to gauge whether or not you have the experience and talent to make the business a success.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s01_p02">Your job is to summarize, highlight, and organize your experiences and skills so that it is easy for an employer or loan officer to see what you have to offer. There are guidelines available to help you format your resume and cover letter in an organized and effective manner. Even the most impressive professional experiences can come across poorly if they are displayed on an unorganized resume.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s01_p03">Most of this chapter is written from the perspective of a job search. We have done this so that you will be able to reference the chapter upon graduation to look for a job. However, the same lessons are equally useful in applying for a loan for the purposes of our iPhone assignment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s01_p04">Initially, employers spend an average of less than one minute looking over a resume, so you need to sell yourself well by having a resume that stands apart from the rest. A resume is your first impression to a potential employer. During a job search, it is the most important tool you can use to get your foot in the door for an interview with a desired employer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s01_p05">This chapter will provide valuable guidelines to help you create a well-designed and organized resume and cover letter.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s02_p01">Many information systems projects are conceived of in a life cycle that progresses in stages from analysis to implementation. The diagram below shows the stages that we touch in the current chapter:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating a Cover Letter</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_p01">When sending a resume to an employer, it is often appropriate to include a cover letter. The purpose of a cover letter is to introduce yourself, explain your reason for contacting the employer, and to sell yourself as a desirable candidate for employment.</p>
        <div class="section" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s01_p01">A cover letter may be your first contact to an employer, or it could be a follow up from a previous meeting. If it is a follow up, remind the employer about your interaction to help him or her recall the original meeting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s02" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reason for Contact</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p01">A cover letter should explain your reason for contacting an employer. There are two types of cover letters: letters of inquiry and letters of application. A letter of inquiry is written when you want more information regarding potential job openings. A letter of application is written when you know specifically which position you would like to obtain and to inform an employer of your qualifications for employment. In both types of letters, you should include information that you already know about the employer and/or position and why you are interested in working for the company. This shows your interest and demonstrates that you have taken the time to research the company.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s03" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Sell Yourself</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s03_p01">A cover letter should be used to sell yourself more effectively to a potential employer. In a resume, you have limited space to outline yourself and your experiences. In a cover letter, you have much more space to highlight your skills and what you can contribute to the company. You can use the letter to expand upon your best qualities or most important experiences or achievements. You can also emphasize information that directly relates to the position for which you are applying, furthering your chances for consideration. It also allows you to demonstrate your written communication skills.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Writing and Printing a Cover Letter</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s04_p01">Cover letters should be personalized and should be prepared individually with each job application. They should be addressed to a specific person, not just a company or department. You can find employee addresses in directories on the company website or through a personal inquiry. CareerSearch®, is a web-based employer research system, and the VAULT  Online Career Library are two other ways to research companies and find contact information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s03_s04_p02">Cover letters should be no more than one page long and should be produced on the same paper as your resume and reference sheet. Also, be sure to double check grammar and spelling to avoid unprofessional errors, and use an organized and neat letter format.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating a Resume</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s04_p01">A resume is an employer’s first impression of a potential employee. Before you start creating a resume, you will need to gather information concerning your skills and experiences and decide on a career goal.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s04_s01_p01">As you gain career experiences, you will need to update your resume. You may also want to tweak your resume for specific positions for which you are applying to include your knowledge and skills pertaining to that particular job. Though each copy of your resume that you hand out may differ slightly, most resumes need to have the same basic content.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s04_s02_p01">A resume should contain your personal contact information so an employer can reach you for an interview. It should be displayed prominently toward the top of your resume and should include your name, address, phone number, a personal website (if you have one) and an e-mail address. Be sure that you use a professional e-mail address.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s04_s03_p01">Including an objective on a resume is optional. If you decide not to include an objective, be sure to state this information in your cover letter. An objective should be clear, concise, and should state what you can do for an organization rather than what it can do for you. It should also be updated for each position or employer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_p01">Most people are familiar with traditional interviews and can anticipate what type of questions they will be asked in the interview process. Many companies are now using behavioral interview questions in order to discover an applicant’s skills and capabilities.</p>
        <div class="section" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Traditional Interviews</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_p02">In a traditional interview, applicants are asked about themselves and their experiences found on their resume. Possible questions include:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s01_l01" mark="bullet">
                <li>
                  “Please tell me a little about yourself.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  “What are your strengths and weaknesses?”
                </li>
                <li>
                  “Why do you think you are the best candidate for this position?”

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s02_p01">In a behavioral interview, the skills and characteristics desired for the chosen employee have already been decided, and the questions that will be asked will be based on those qualifications and will require interviewees to give specific examples of past experiences and how they have handled those situations. This helps the employer see how candidates are likely to perform in similar situations likely to occur in the new position. These questions may be interspersed in conversation or they may be in a set list of questions to be answered. An example question may be, “Describe a difficult problem that you tried to solve. How did you identify the problem and solve it?”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s03_p01">Employers most commonly look for the following skill sets during an interview:</p>

                <li>Problem solving</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s04_p01">Before an interview, you can prepare by planning to answer possible questions that may be asked. Since no two interviews are alike, it is wise to prepare for both behavioral and traditional interview questions. By reading the position’s description, you can often get a sense of what types of questions will be asked and which of your skills you should be prepared to discuss. Also, be sure to review your resume before an interview to remind yourself of experiences you can talk about with the employer.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s05_p01">Employers who ask behavior-based questions want interviewees to describe specific projects, situations, or experiences that can apply to the open position. Before answering a behavior-based question, make sure you understand the question and do not be afraid to ask for clarification if something is vague or unclear. In each response, the interviewer is looking for three main things:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s05_l01" mark="bullet">
                <li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">R</strong>esult — show the outcome or solution</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s06_p01">By including a problem or situation description, your actions, and a solution in your answer, you can respond to interview questions on <strong class="emphasis bold">PAR</strong>. Your responses will help the interviewer understand how you behaved in a certain scenario and determine if you would be a good fit for the open position. Below are two examples of complete and well-structured responses to behavioral interviews questions:</p>

					</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s06_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">P</strong>: I was working on a team with four others on a project in my Management capstone course. Our roles in the assignment were delegated by our group leader, and one member of our team wasn’t doing her portion of the work. Our group leader even confronted her during a group meeting, but she just shrugged and said she was trying, but I could tell she was embarrassed to talk about it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s06_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">A</strong>: After our meeting, I suggested that she and I meet for coffee. I asked her how she felt about the project and how her section was coming along. She explained that she wasn’t confident about doing the research task she was given because she didn’t know how to use many of the resources that were required by our professor. She said she felt badly but was embarrassed to be singled out in front of the whole group. I told her that we could have a general discussion about the project tasks in the next group meeting so she wouldn’t be singled out. During that meeting, I suggested that everyone share their general strengths instead of weaknesses and encouraged everyone to participate. It turned out that her strength was editing and formatting, and the person formally responsible for that portion of the project had a knack for research, so they switched tasks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s06_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">R</strong>: Because they were both more comfortable with their new responsibilities, they were happier and more productive. I learned from that experience that laziness isn’t always the reason that people don’t participate, and it’s important to find out what motivates people in order to help create a productive and cohesive team.</p>

I was taking a speech class that required us to give five minute speeches in front of the class every other week. For my first speech, we were asked to evaluate our favorite Super Bowl commercial and explain why we felt it marketed so well to its audience. I was nervous during my presentation, but felt I covered everything I needed and that it went well. Afterward the presentation, the professor gave me a C+. I set up a meeting to speak with her the next day during office hours.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s06_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">A</strong>: She explained to me that I didn’t follow the necessary format for my presentation. She also mentioned that I could have made better eye contact and engaged my audience more. At this point, I felt since this was my first speech class that my approach and preparation for my speeches may not be working. I needed to make some adjustments to my presentation technique, and I started attending weekly help sessions with one of her teaching assistants. In addition to those sections, I asked my professor for some additional feedback prior to each presentation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch13_s01_s05_s06_p09"><strong class="emphasis bold">R</strong>: I received an A on the very next presentation and every presentation afterward.
