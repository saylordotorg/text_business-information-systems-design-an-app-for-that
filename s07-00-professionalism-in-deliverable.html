            <p class="para" id="frost-ch03_s00_p01">“We are all inherently visual communicators. Consider kindergarten: crayons, finger paints, and clay propelled our expression, not word processors or spreadsheets…” </p>
            <p class="para" id="frost-ch03_s00_p02">“Unfortunately, somewhere, at some time, someone probably told you that you weren’t very good at drawing. And, after looking around and comparing yourself to other kids in the classroom, you probably consented, threw in the towel, and decided that piano lessons or football might prove a better bet for primary education glory.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="frost-ch03_s00_p03">“Now, as an adult, you may not try anymore—at least in the visual realm. This is ironic considering that your employers and colleagues assess you by how well you communicate—a skill that is reflected in annual reviews, pay increases, promotions, and even your popularity. Effective communication is a job requirement now, whether you’re trying to beat competitors, communicate vision, demonstrate thought leadership, raise capital, or otherwise change the world. And like it or not, your profession likely requires you to communicate using a visual tool, regardless of your proficiency or training in this medium. Business schools in particular drill their students in management, accounting, and technology, but few offer anything approaching Design 101—the one thing that combines creative thinking, analytics, data assimilation, and the inherent ability to express oneself visually.”<span class="footnote" id="frost-fn01_001">Duarte, Nancy, <em class="emphasis">Slide:ology: the Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations</em>, O’Reilly Media, Inc. 2008, p2.</span></p>
