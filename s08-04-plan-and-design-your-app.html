        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s01_p01">Your app needs to solve a business problem for someone in order to be marketable. For the sake of this lesson, your classmates compose your target market—people like you.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Define Requirements with Process Flows</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s02_p01">After analyzing the business problem, you need to set requirements for the design of your app. We will envision requirements using process flow diagrams.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s02_p02">Some students struggle with what they should create for their app screens until they do process flows. The key is to construct an app swim lane in the process flow. Then look at the app swim lane of the To-Be process flow to help determine which screens to create. The screens should follow logically by looking at the action the app is taking (e.g. ask user X or show user X). The connection will not necessarily be one screen per action. In fact you may have multiple screens for each action. It depends upon the level of detail in your process flow.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s02_p03">Creating a planning diagram almost always saves time in the end. It is much easier to add, update, and remove actions from a process diagram than it is to add, update, and remove screens from your app.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s02_p04">Process flows also highlight the importance of doing business process management and business process redesign and why business process is so important to information systems.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s02_p05">How different will your As-Is and To-Be diagrams be? If you are migrating an existing computerized process to the iPhone, they may be fairly similar. However, if you are comparing a non-computerized process to one that uses an iPhone, then they are likely to be quite different.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Design Your App According to Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s03_p01">Now that we have discussed target markets, laws of branding, icon design, and process flows, you are ready to design your iPhone app. Your app should have a close relationship with your process flows. In other words, the actions identified for the app in the process flows should be illustrated in the mockups.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s03_p02">Fortunately, the iPhone interface is highly standardized, which means you have fewer decisions to make about the placement and style of interface elements. This allows you to focus more on the content of your app.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">

        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s03_p03">The status bar should appear at the very top of the screen and display important information about the device itself. The status bar displays information such as the current time, battery level, network provider, and network strength.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s03_p04">The navigation bar appears at the top of the screen directly under the status bar and displays the title of the page currently being viewed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s03_p05">The tab bar always appears at the bottom of the screen and should appear on every screen of your app. The tab bar allows the user to switch modes or views very easily.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The MockApp Template and Library</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s04_p01">To create your iPhone app, you need access to all of the screen elements on the iPhone. Fortunately, there is a wonderful PowerPoint template called MockApp, which contains a comprehensive set of iPhone screen elements. MockApp is located at <a class="link" href="http://mockapp.com">MockApp.com</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s04_p02">When you download MockApp you will have access to two files—a template and a library. The template is simply a series of blank iPhone screens that you populate with the appropriate screen elements from the library.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s04_p03">Your task is to copy screen elements from the library and then paste them into the template. You then rearrange and relabel screen elements to simulate a working app.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s04_s04_p04">Because PowerPoint supports hyperlinks among slides, you can even simulate buttons that navigate among screens in your app. In this manner, you can create a photo realistic mockup.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">

            <p class="para">The MockApp template and library are depicted here opened simultaneously in overlapping windows. We recommend setting up in this way. The library consists of a series of PowerPoint slides each having an array of iPhone screen elements. The library slide shown here is for keyboards—but there are many other library slides. Copy elements off any of these library slides and paste them into the blank iPhone template. Then customize the text to suit your app. <a class="link" href="http://mockapp.com">MockApp.com</a> screen shot reprinted with permission from Dotan Saguy.</p>

            <p class="para" id="frost-ch04_s04_s04_p07">When brainstorming iPhone Apps it is sometimes helpful to look at other apps already developed. The best way to check out other apps is on the iTunes store (iTunes is free). However, even if you do not have iTunes loaded, you can check out apps at the following link: <a class="link" href="http://app-store.appspot.com/">http://app-store.appspot.com/</a></p>
            <p class="para" id="frost-ch04_s04_s04_p08">We can not overstate the importance of the assignments in this chapter. The rest of the course will build on what you create here. Your app will be viewed by your classmates so make it something you can be proud of.</p>
            <p class="para" id="frost-ch04_s04_s04_p09">Your classmates will “buy” your app in a future assignment, so the app needs to appeal to them either for their own consumption or to be given as a gift. You will also construct financial projections for your app in a future chapter. Finally, your report at the end of the course will be a culmination of all the deliverables you have constructed about your app to that point.</p>
