        <h2 class="title editable block">Actors and Actions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p01">Improving a business process requires first understanding the process. Diagramming the steps in the process contributes greatly to that understanding. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Business process diagrams</a><span class="glossdef">Business processes may be represented by process diagrams containing actors in swim lanes and actions connected by arrows. Decision points in a business process are represented by diamonds.</span></span> typically consist of actions linked by arrows. However, it is also important to be clear about who is performing each action. For this reason we create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">swim lane</a><span class="glossdef">A vertical portion of a business process diagram.</span></span> for each actor in the process. The actors pass a metaphorical baton among themselves at different stages of the process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p02">An easy way to diagram a business process is to first identify all of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">actors</a><span class="glossdef">A person or computer who takes actions or makes decisions in a business process.</span></span> and place each in a swim lane. The process begins at the top of the page and continues down the page following the arrows. Arrows represent communication among the actors, while diamonds represent decision points. While actors are normally people, a computer standing in for the role of a person can also be an actor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p03">At times we can simplify the business process diagram by eliminating all but the essential elements. This makes the diagram less cluttered and easier to read. On the facing page we have a process diagram reduced to just three elements — swim lanes, actions, and arrows.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s01_p04">For the level of analysis needed in this course, the simplified diagram is more than sufficient. However, it is good to know the full lexicon, especially the decision point diamond shown on the next page.</p>

In this solution Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags in the boxes communicate with their surroundings to report their geographic position back to the help desk.

        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch02_s02_s02_p01">What we showed on the prior page is actually a simplified form of a business process diagram. For the purpose of this course, the simplified form works just fine. However for the sake of completeness, we show a more advanced diagram more in the spirit of Universal Modeling Language (UML). It is not that the UML style diagram is better—just that you should be prepared to see it. The following table lists some of the symbols that you might encounter in a process flow diagram.</p>
