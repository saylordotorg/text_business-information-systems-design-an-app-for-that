        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s01_p01">PowerPoint presentations have become the standard method of presenting information in corporate America. This program is not only used in corporations; however, even professional sports teams and the military use PowerPoint to convey information internally.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Yet, there are still those who claim that PowerPoint is one of the least effective forms of communication for many reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s01_l01" mark="bullet">
            <li>Most presenters use slides with words only and yet very few words fit on a slide.</li>
            <li>Presenters tend to cram an entire idea—no matter how complex—onto a single slide.</li>
            <li>Most presentations are thrown together with limited preparation, and the goal of most presentations is to summarize and sell ideas rather than to engage the audience in serious discourse.</li>
            <li>Slides are only displayed one at a time. Therefore, the audience has the difficult task of trying to remember what information appeared on previous slides.</li>
            <li>Presenters tend to read their slides.</li>
            <li>Presenters tend to look at the screen when reading the slides thereby avoiding eye contact with the audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s01_p03">The result are presentations that are visually bland, intellectually insulting, and easily forgettable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s01_p04">During your college career, you will use PowerPoint for almost every class in which you or a group has to do a presentation. In this chapter, you will learn how to make those presentations great. Presentations should explain material clearly and concisely while also prompting the audience to take a certain course of action.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s01_p05">A PowerPoint presentation should be a complement to your schematic report. In fact, you should be able to generate the PowerPoint presentation fairly quickly from your schematic report.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="frost-ch12_s01_s02" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Where Are We in the Life Cycle?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s02_p01">Many information systems projects are conceived of in a life cycle that progresses in stages from analysis to implementation. The diagram below shows the stages that we touch in the current chapter:</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_16/502b7d0c9c991e4529571f627f24fa7f.png">

    </div>
    <div class="section" id="frost-ch12_s01_s03" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Presentation Content</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s03_p01">You need to determine the purpose of the presentation and possible circumstances or contexts in which the presentation might be given. This is a time to showcase your ideas and highlight all of the great things about your project. Be concise and powerful. This may be the most crucial deliverable of the project—especially if given to higher-ups who will have only skimmed the actual report.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s03_p02">Think of your presentation as an illustrated version of the executive summary of your schematic report. If you look at it that way, you have already done the work! Each idea from your executive summary should correspond to a slide. Pull ideas out of your executive summary and illustrate them with exhibits from inside the report. Each illustration should be accompanied by a sentence. The sentence can come from the executive summary or from the relevant slide in the report. You may even find that in the process, you end up revising and improving your executive summary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s03_p03">Not every slide needs to be illustrated, and not every illustration needs to be included. A slide with a single sentence and no illustration may actually have great visual impact by contrast with the rest of the report. Furthermore, some of your illustrations may simply set up foundation knowledge or due diligence and need not make it to the presentation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s03_p04">To finish up, create slides that bookend your presentation with an agenda up front and a summary at the end. Follow the old adage, tell them what you are going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you told them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s03_p05">Here are some additional tips:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s03_o01" numeration="arabic">
            <li>Master the content. 90% of the words that come out of your mouth will not be on the slide. You want the audience to look at you not the slide. Furthermore, if you know your content, you can look at the audience. If necessary, have note cards that you could refer to in an emergency.</li>
            <li>Try to avoid handing out miniatures of your slides. Slides created using the method above will be virtually meaningless without the presenter. Hand out the schematic report or even just the executive summary instead.</li>
        </ol>

            <p class="para">Depicting the process of moving from an executive summary to a PowerPoint presentation. Each sentence in your executive summary can form a slide heading (use your judgement). Then pull the images from your schematic report and enlarge them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Slide Design - Themes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s04_p01">PowerPoint comes with many different themes to apply to your slides. In general, try to choose either a very light or a very dark colored background. Anything in between will wash out in a bright room.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s04_p02">Themes cannot save a text heavy slide. It is still a boring slide and the speaker may feel obligated to read it to the audience. Many students turn to a dark background theme with the hope that it will convey more professionalism. However, as you can see, it doesn’t solve the problem of a boring slide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s04_p03">A better option is to move most of the words to your schematic report and instead make your point in a dramatic visual fashion. Visual slides take much longer to create but could differentiate your presentation from every other boring PowerPoint presentation making yours more persuasive.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">

        <h2 class="title editable block">Slide Design - Principles</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s05_p01">You want your presentation to be professional and engaging. To get there you will need the C.R.A.P. principles you have already learned. You will also need stylistic enhancements that come under the heading of Presentation Zen. Finally a little (and we do mean <em class="emphasis">little</em>) multimedia—embedded video or subtle use of animation serves to spice up a presentation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s05_p02">The C.R.A.P. graphic design principles apply to slide design as well. Contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity help organize information on your slide, focus attention, and create an overall professional look and feel.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s05_p03">Highly visual presentations with very few words are popularized by Garr Reynolds in his book, <em class="emphasis">Presentation Zen</em>. Reynolds advocates restraint, simplicity, and naturalness. The idea is that the slides naturally support your presentation rather than serving as a narrative. You are supposed to know your material.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s05_p04">Presentation Zen slides are characterized by very large illustrations—often full page bleeds—and usually just one sentence of text. This is called the picture superiority effect—basically that pictures are more memorable than words.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s05_p05">Three other Presentation Zen principles are to aim for a high signal to noise ratio, make good use of empty space, and align images using the rule of thirds. These will be covered next.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_16/d144d59062a40f5ea30e688078cc709a.png">
            <p class="para">Presentation Zen in action. Above a text heavy slide cannot be saved no matter which PowerPoint theme is applied. Below the key message of the slide is illustrated by a full page bleed of a picture of the damaged tiles of a previous shuttle flight. We also enlarge and crop the foam picture. Text is set in white on a black fill for contrast. Which slide do you find more interesting, and memorable? Images reprinted from NASA.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">High Signal to Noise Ratio: Inform, Don’t Decorate</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s06_p01">Every item on your slide should be there for a reason. You are trying to inform the reader and transfer information. You should not aim to decorate your slide with meaningless fluff.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s06_p02">In technical terms you want a strong communication signal and very weak distracting noise in your slide. This is called a high signal to noise ratio. Normally, words, numbers, and graphs are your communications signal—the information you are trying to convey. Pictures can also be part of that signal if they are used judiciously—otherwise they become part of the noise.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_16/26e4981b2892c73464dbabc637e3e6e4.png">
            <p class="para">Our preference is for the top slide. With no distracting illustrations the audience can focus on the content. However, the illustration in the middle slide is calm enough so as to be acceptable. The bottom slide is just too busy—it has too much noise.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Use of Empty Space: White Space Is Good!</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s07_p01">Resist the temptation to fill every available space on your slide with words or images. White space is good! White space is pleasing to the eye and can represent balance and harmony.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s07_p02">However, too much white space might convey that you don’t have very much to say about a particular topic, or that it is not important. Again, it’s all about balance.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_16/78cfdd7df7b4f12e2ba17d2ca60bdd47.png">
            <p class="para">The top slide makes good use of white space to let the image breathe. The bottom slide tries to use up all of the white space and in the process horribly distorts the slide. If it looks cartoonish, then don’t do it.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="section" id="frost-ch12_s01_s08" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s08_p01">One of the advantages of using a full page bleed is that the picture is often larger than the slide. This gives you the option of positioning and cropping the picture for maximum visual impact.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s08_p02">For many years professional photographers have used the rule of thirds to compose a picture, and you can too. Simply divide the slide horizontally and vertically in thirds using the guides (see technique). The place where the lines meet are called “power points.” No lie. Try to place your subject whether words or images at the power points for maximum visual impact.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_16/722bb31226afdb7f75f29a5f6e8c499b.png">
            <p class="para">This full page bleed was positioned and cropped so that the key illustrations and text would appear on the “power points” of the slide. The power points are determined by the rule of thirds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_16/986c60108ccc99d05f152a7a9c011047.png">

    <div class="section" id="frost-ch12_s01_s09" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Fills for Text Blocks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s09_p01">The problem with a full page bleed is that the text may be unreadable on top of the image depending on the image. One easy solution is to place the text on top of a fill. The fill may be solid (opaque) or semi-transparent if you would like the picture to show through. In either case, the fill allows you to add dimensionality to your document in much the same way that magazines layer text and graphics on their covers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s09_p02">The easiest way to create this effect is to create a layout on the master slide. Reposition the title so that it completely covers a strip at the top or bottom of the slide. Then right-click and format the text box adding a fill and adjusting the text color as necessary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s09_p03">To ensure consistency among slides, turn OFF the auto—fit text. Instead simply set the font size to 24 point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch12_s01_s09_p04">On individual slides you may have to arrange layers so that the text box sits on top rather than below the graphic.</p>
