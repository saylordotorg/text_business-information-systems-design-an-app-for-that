        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s01_p01">MIS is infused into all the other business disciplines. Marketing is no exception. The relationship is even more pronounced when the item being marketed is itself an MIS product—such as an iPhone app.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s01_p02">In this chapter you will design an iPhone app and create a photo realistic mockup of the app. To do this you need to apply both MIS and marketing skills. Marketing skills help to establish the need for the app—is it something that will sell? MIS skills help to craft the product in order to meet those needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s01_p03">At some point in their lives many students dream of starting their own business. The iPhone has given hope to millions of entrepreneurs to do just that by creating and selling an app. You will have the opportunity to envision your own <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">app</a><span class="glossdef">An application or app is a computer program that runs on the iPhone. The term is also used for programs running on other platforms such as the iPad, Android phone, or indeed any computer. The iTunes store categorizes apps as follows: Books • Business • Education • Entertainment • Finance • Games • Healthcare &amp; Fitness • Lifestyle • Medical • Music • Navigation • News • Photography • Productivity • Reference • Social Networking • Sports • Travel • Utilities • Weather</span></span> and make a mockup of that app in PowerPoint or KeyNote.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s01_p04">Every MIS product, including an iPhone app, should be designed with a specific group of people in mind. These groups, called market segments, are normally described demographically using characteristics such as age, income, location, gender, and so forth. When a company identifies a market segment upon which it will focus its efforts, that becomes the target market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s01_p05">For this class, your target market is your classmates. To make it even more real we ask that you develop a fictional persona in the target market. You design the app for that persona. You need to develop a brand position that will distinguish your app from the competition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s01_p06">An app should improve a process through higher efficiency or effectiveness. Taking a detailed look at a current process diagram will help you identify where and how a process can be improved and enable you to design an enhanced future process. Through understanding the app’s market segmentation and analyzing the process, a popular app can be put on the market.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Where Are We in the Life Cycle?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s02_p01">Many information systems projects are conceived of in a life cycle that progresses in stages from analysis to implementation. The diagram below shows the stages that we touch in the current chapter:</p>

    <div class="section" id="frost-ch04_s01_s03" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Designing for a Target Market</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s03_p01">Marketers identify groups of potential customers for a company’s product. This process is called market segmentation. Markets can be segmented based on a variety of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">demographics</a><span class="glossdef">A way to categorize groups of people using age, income level, gender, education level, home ownership, and so forth.</span></span>, or characteristics of the population. Examples include age, income level, gender, hobbies, or interests. Each group is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market segment</a><span class="glossdef">A group of potential customers for a product or service. Segments are typically identified by demographics.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s03_p02">Marketing dollars are best spent targeting the segments most likely to buy the product. It would be unwise to waste money on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">promotional campaigns</a><span class="glossdef">The marketing communication that is aimed at the target market. This includes ads, news releases, and so forth. Marketers must try to accurately predict what type of campaign will appeal to the target market while staying consistent with the brand.</span></span> aimed at audiences not interested in a particular product. For example, a good marketer would not tailor an ad campaign for low-rise jeans to 50-year-old men. Part of the marketer’s job is to persuade the members of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">target market</a><span class="glossdef">The segment that is chosen or targeted by the company. Promotional campaigns are aimed at the target market.</span></span> that they need the product.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s03_p03">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has little difficulty convincing 14 to 24-year-olds that they need A&amp;F branded merchandise. However, it would be much harder to sell this merchandise to an older age segment. A good marketer knows not to target everyone for a certain product. Instead, they target only those segments most likely to be interested. The challenge for marketers is to find a way to appeal to each target segment. For A&amp;F, a large part of their appeal is sex — a theme of great interest to its target market. However, universities recruiting students in the same age group would most likely not use sex as an appeal in their advertising. Universities do not use sex appeal because although students are their customers, it is likely that their parents will have veto power over the final decision in college selection. Therefore, a marketer’s job becomes more difficult when there are multiple decision makers, each with different needs and wants.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s03_p04">One common marketing mistake, known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">majority fallacy</a><span class="glossdef">The targeting of only the largest segment or group of segments, when a smaller loyal segment could be more profitable.</span></span>, is to exclusively pursue those segments that make up the majority of the market. Marketers most likely do this because the competition is also pursuing those segments. It may be wiser to go after a smaller segment, or a niche, that is under served by the competition. Concentrating on a small, highly defined segment is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">niche marketing</a><span class="glossdef">A narrow and highly defined target market. For example, a niche market might be 21 year old females who drive red economy cars and drink diet Coke.</span></span>. This type of marketing can be very profitable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s03_p05">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">power of a brand</a><span class="glossdef">Narrowly defining a product or service so that it provokes a single positive image in the mind of the consumer—such as “cool” for Apple Computer.</span></span> is proportional to its focus. A brand should not try to target everyone. Instead, a brand should narrowly define a product and all of its benefits. Mention of a brand should conjure a single word in the consumer’s imagination, such as “sporty” (Mini Cooper), “safety” (Volvo), or “luxury” (Lexus).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">User centered design</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s04_p01">The MIS methodology best suited to designing for a target market is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">user centered design</a><span class="glossdef">Changing the design to fit the user rather than asking the user to accommodate the design.</span></span>. According to Wikipedia, “The chief difference from other product design philosophies is that user-centered design tries to optimize the product around how users can, want, or need to use the product, rather than forcing the users to change their behavior to accommodate the product.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s04_p02">In a later chapter we will look at some heuristic rules of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">usability</a><span class="glossdef">How easy a product is to use.</span></span>—how easy something is to navigate and use—especially as applied to websites. However, in this chapter we are envisioning the overall <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">user experience (UX)</a><span class="glossdef">“A person’s perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service” ISO 9241-210</span></span>. What would a person in our target market actually want the app to do? How would they want it to behave? Can we make using the app a natural and pleasant experience?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="frost-ch04_s01_s04_p03">Designers have found that it is a lot easier to answer these questions if you first envision a user in the target market. This fictional user is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">persona</a><span class="glossdef">A fictional person from the target market created by the designer to help influence design choices.</span></span>. Once a persona, say Fred, is created then designers can debate what Fred would like based on agreed upon characteristics of Fred. Of course Fred is no substitute for testing an app with real users, but he does help get you off the ground and moving in the right direction.</p>
